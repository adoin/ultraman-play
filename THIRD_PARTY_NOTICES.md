## Ultraman Tiga — first-person arms

"Ultraman Tiga" by **Extrazhang**, obtained from https://blendswap.com/blend/26877 and https://blendswap.com/blend/26877/download.

The creator's download page declares **CC-BY-NC** and asks users to credit Extrazhang. No license version is stated on that page. Creator profile: https://blendswap.com/profile/1180296 . The game and model derivative are noncommercial.

The game uses a first-person derivative of the continuous arm mesh. Each arm retains 18 articulated joints and includes the measured distance from the center of the eyes to the shoulder. The adaptation includes surface smoothing, the original UV pattern, calibrated suit colors, portable metallic-roughness materials and action poses anchored to the source eye and shoulder measurements. Source provenance and the original file hash are in `art/sources/tiga/SOURCE.md`.

The on-screen **制作与鸣谢** presents this attribution and modification notice. This is community fan art, with no official affiliation asserted.

## Full-body motion preview

The independent punch preview uses **Punch_Cross** by **Quaternius**, from [Universal Animation Library](https://quaternius.com/packs/universalanimationlibrary.html), licensed under [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). The motion is retargeted to the Extrazhang Tiga derivative above. Adaptations include wrist and foot placement for the different body proportions, a first-person head mask and a camera at the source eye midpoint. The combined character asset is distributed for this noncommercial game. Both source credits appear on the preview page.

## Victory take-off

The end-of-adventure celebration uses the **downloaded community Tiga model** described in `art/sources/迪迦/SOURCE.md`. That pack ships 60 Max-Biped vertex groups but no armature, and its FBX has no weights at all. `art/import_tiga_flight.py` rebuilds a 68-bone Biped skeleton from the weighted vertex clusters (twist bones mark each limb's midpoint, so joints are extrapolated from the twist centroid and the next joint), aims the right arm into a raised-fist take-off pose, turns the figure to face -Y using the toe direction, bakes the armature and exports `public/motion-preview/tiga-flight.glb`. The left arm keeps its authored A-pose because the reconstructed elbow pivot is not accurate enough to rotate it without shearing the sleeve. The ascent, body tilt, turn, sky darkening and star fade are authored in `src/scene.js`.

The pack carries no author credit and states that it is for non-commercial study only; the game is non-commercial fan work and this limitation is recorded with the pack's file hashes in `art/sources/迪迦/SOURCE.md`.

The **Idle_Torch_Loop** retarget (Quaternius Universal Animation Library, CC0 1.0) remains reproducible through the same script for the Extrazhang arm rig, but the game no longer references it.

## Original game models

The basalt, leviathan and nova creature models were authored for this project using art/create_models.py in Blender. They do not use downloaded creature meshes, textures or animations. Editable masters are in art/models; runtime GLBs in public/models/kaiju. Runtime movement animates their named node pivots. The original procedural gauntlet master remains as an archived source; the current first-person arms use the separately attributed Tiga derivative above.
